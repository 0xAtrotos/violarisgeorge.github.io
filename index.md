## George Violaris

I am a programmer, systems engineer and computers & network security specialist from Nicosia, Cyprus.

I am experienced in the design and development of secure web applications and web services. I work with Java, Go & Python and an array of databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MongoDB) as well as SOAP, JSON-RPC and REST web service protocols.

Over the years I’ve worked extensively in Microsoft technologies (MSSQL, Sharepoint, Exchange Server, Active Directory), and Linux environments (RedHat, CentOS and Ubuntu). I have been involved in implementing and maintaining networks and developing security policies and mechanisms to protect the networks and data of companies from vulnerabilities and other kinds of potential threats that can compromise computer security and data integrity.

Additionally, in the past two years I have familiarized myself with blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency protocols such as Bitcoin, CryptoNote and Nxt.
