## About me
With over 15 years of experience spanning across tech, finance, insurance, venture capital, and private equity industries, I bring a wealth of expertise as a seasoned software engineer, technologist, and team leader. Skilled in a wide array of technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Java, Python, Go, Rust, databases, web services, and APIs, I have played a pivotal role in driving innovation and delivering impactful solutions throughout my career.

Armed with a BSc degree in Computer Science and a Masters degree in Computer Network Security, I bring a solid foundation in both theory and practice to the table. Currently serving as the Chief Technology Officer at [Hatchworks VC](https://hatchworksvc.com), Tech Lead at [SkillGaming](https://skillgaming.com) and Technical Advisor at [Phoenix](https://phoenixapp.io), I lead a dynamic team focused on building hyper-casual mini skill game platforms, pioneering GameFi solutions, and exploring the vast potential of DeFi and blockchain.

I'm a firm believer in the power of teamwork, reliability, authenticity, and integrity, and I strive to foster these values in every project I undertake. Passionate about the boundless possibilities that the web offers for expression and innovation, I am dedicated to helping organizations and individuals realize their full potential and achieve their goals.

As we navigate through the digital age, I am committed to staying at the forefront of technological advancements, leveraging communication, positivity, and a forward-thinking mindset to drive positive change. In my quest for knowledge and inspiration, I curate a collection of intriguing resources on my website, reflecting my insatiable curiosity and passion for continuous learning. Join me as we embark on a journey of exploration, innovation, and growth in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. Together, let's build a brighter futureâ€”one line of code at a time.
