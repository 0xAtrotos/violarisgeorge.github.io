## About me ⚡️

> This page is my home on the internet. I am a security engineer, sysadmin and programmer, decentralization and cryptocurrency lover, cypherpunk wannabe, and cryptography student [#golang](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23golang&src=typd) [#bitcoin](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bitcoin&src=typd) [#blockchain](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blockchain&src=tyah) [#p2p](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23p2p&src=typd) [#privacy](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23privacy&src=typd). 

### [Curriculum Vitae](cv.html#curriculum-vitae)

I work on securing infrastructure and enterprise information systems. I provide technological solutions to make business procedures and insight more efficient and profitable. Microsoft technologies (MSSQL, Sharepoint, Exchange Server, Active Directory), Linux systems (RedHat, CentOS and Ubuntu), virtualization environments such as vmWare (vSphere, vCenter, Orchestrator) and Veeam for backup and replication are utilized to provide complete solution integration. I believe in using a holistic approach in each project I manage, taking into consideration all surrounding technologies that can either affect or benefit the project in one way or another. I am heavily involved in implementing and maintaining networks, and developing security policies and mechanisms to protect organizations from vulnerabilities and other kinds of potential threats that can compromise computer security and data integrity.

Software development projects I have been involved with include secure GPS tracking servers, intranet applications, customer portals, and web services to enrich the availability of back-end systems. In the past few years my coding weapons of choice are Go Language, Java, PHP, and Python. I prefer to develop on frameworks that I know well and I am more comfortable with, unless the project demands otherwise. Such frameworks include Revel (Go), Buffalo (Go), Spring (Java), CodeIgniter (PHP), and Django (Python). 

After finishing my degree in Computer Science in 2011, I decided to take a direction towards computer and network security and I completed a graduate course in this field. Additionally, to gain the necessary experience and insight, in the past few years I've ventured into systems and network administration, security policy design, and security architecture design and implementation. 

I found out about Bitcoin and blockchain technologies around 2011-2012 and have since been studying about building systems and programming around those technologies. I am passionate about research and have contributed to a few projects. Furthermore, I have published peer reviewed papers in computer networks and security.

My research interests include distributed and decentralized systems, P2P networks, automated attack preventions, anonymous communications, trustless systems, and zero-knowledge proof protocols.

In my resources page I keep some of the material which are of interest to me and have helped to expand my knowledge on certain subjects.
