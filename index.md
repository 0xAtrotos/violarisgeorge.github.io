### [Curriculum Vitae](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S-FT1L2wckhwe0x9xNELQz9nVRV-eEAV)

I work on securing infrastructure and enterprise information systems. I provide technological solutions to make business procedures and insight more efficient and profitable. Microsoft technologies (MSSQL, Sharepoint, Exchange Server, Active Directory), Linux systems (RedHat, CentOS and Ubuntu), virtualization environments such as vmWare (vSphere, vCenter, Orchestrator) and Veeam for backup and replication are utilized to provide complete solution integration. I believe in using a holistic approach in each project I manage, taking into consideration all surrounding technologies that can either affect or benefit the project in one way or another.

I am heavily involved in implementing and maintaining networks and developing security policies and mechanisms to protect organizations from vulnerabilities and other kinds of potential threats that can compromise computer security and data integrity.

I have worked a number of years in web and software development using PHP, Python and Java, in mostly intranet applications and customer portals as well as building web services to enrich the availability of back-end systems. After finishing my degree in Computer Science in 2010, I decided to take a direction towards computer and network security and I completed a graduate course in this field. Additionally, to gain the necessary experience and insight, in the past few years I've ventured into systems and network administration. I found out about Bitcoin and blockchain technologies around 2011-2012 and have since been studying building and programming around those technologies. I am passionate about research and have both contributed to research as well as published peer reviewed papers in computer networks and security.

My research interests include distributed systems, P2P networks, brute force and automated attack preventions, trustless systems and zero-knowledge proof protocols.

In my resources page I keep some of the material which are of interest to me and help me expand my knowledge on certain subjects.
