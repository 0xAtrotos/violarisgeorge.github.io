## About me
Experienced software engineer, technologist and team leader with a 15 year history of working in the tech, finance, insurance, venture capital and private equity industries. Skilled in a wide array of technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Java, Python, Go, databases, web services and APIs. 

I have a BSc degree in Computer Science, a Masters degree in Computer Network Security and over a decade of experience with systems management and development of software and web applications. I'm currently the Chief Technology Officer at [SkillGaming](https://skillgaming.com) a company building hyper-casual mini skill game platforms, GameFi solutions and metaverses.

I'm a big advocate for team work, reliability, authenticity and integrity. I'm very passionate about the freedom of expression that the web provides us, and I really enjoy helping organizations and individuals reach their potential and achieve their goals. The digital age has brought upon us a new industrial revolution and a myriad of new ways to solve new and old problems. My mission is to keep an eye to the future, build upon the shoulders of giants and strive for greatness through technology, communication and positivity.

In my resources page I keep material from the web that I find interesting.
