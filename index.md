## About me
For the last ten years, I have worked on software projects that include development of secure GPS tracking servers, intranet applications, customer portals and web services. My preferred toolset consists of Go, Java, PHP, JavaScript and Python. I prefer to develop on frameworks that follow the highest industry standards to provide fast, maintainable and expandable applications. Such frameworks include Spring MVC, Beego, Buffalo, Laravel and CodeIgniter. For front-end UI development I work with AngularJS and Vue.js.

In my resources page I keep some of the material which are of interest to me and have helped to expand my knowledge on certain subjects.
